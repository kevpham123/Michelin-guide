## Overview

This project is an adaptation of the final project from Data 101 at UC Berkeley. Its primary goal is to explore the strengths and weaknesses of SQL and NoSQL databases and to understand the conditions under which one is more suitable than the other. For this project, I utilized the publicly available [Yelp dataset](https://business.yelp.com/data/resources/open-dataset/), PostgreSQL and MongoDB.
