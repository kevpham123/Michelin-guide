# Michelin Guide

## Kevin Pham
* This project is an adaptation of the final project from Data 101 at UC Berkeley. Its primary goal is to explore the strengths and weaknesses of SQL and NoSQL databases and to understand the conditions under which one is more suitable than the other. The database I used was PostgreSQL and MongoDB. For this project, I utilized the publicly available [Yelp dataset](https://business.yelp.com/data/resources/open-dataset/)
